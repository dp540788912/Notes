# SSH tutorial

## remote server exempt for password
1. generate public keys ~/.ssh

It may ask you where to store the key, just press enter
```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa 
```

2. copy public key to remote server

use either
```
ssh-copy-id usr@remoteAddress
```
this method may fail since ```ssh-copy-id``` is unstable. when this happens:

* copy rsa file yourself 
```
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub usr@address:~/.ssh
```

* append it to authorized_keys
```
ssh usr@address
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

then exit server, next time it will not request a password

* if you are asked to enter a password to make unlock your private key, just enter the passphase you set after -p 


## copy id from local
```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

## copy rsa to remote ssh site 
```
ssh-copy-id root@192.168.10.53 
```
